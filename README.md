A simple, incomplete Eclipse Plugin for the GraphQL-Schema language.

Installation [WIP]:

- Install Xtext into your Eclipse.
- Checkout the `releases` branch.
- Copy the jars from the `dropins` folder into the `dropins` folder in your Eclipse installation.
- Restart Eclipse
- When you open a `*.graphqls` file Xtext will ask you to add the Xtext nature to `.project` -- say "Yes"
